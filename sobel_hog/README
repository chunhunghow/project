HOG(obj_img).overlap_block() will go through the whole image block by block( one block contains 4 cells,a cell contains 8x8 pixels),
  and return a 9-element-vector(1 element for 1 direction;total 180degree) for one cell, and concat into one vector with length 36 
  for one block. N blocks will have N*36 elements can be used as input for svm classification.

obj_img has method obj_img.sobel() ,obj_img.sobelx() , obj_img.sobely() 

Pipenv is required to make install depedencies (make init).
Otherwise numpy, matplotlib are needed in local python lib.
